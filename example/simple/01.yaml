# 
# Node selectors provide options for pulling whole remote hierarchies
# into node (sub)structures, and filtering them to a subset.
structure:
- name: concepts
  # nodeSelector is resolved to a node hierarchy, where nodes are selected
  # by optional filtering criteria, and attached to a container node as its
  # descendants' hierarchy.
  # In this example the specified node selector will be resolved to a node hierarchy
  # produced from the file-folder structure at the specified path. Only Markdown
  # documents are included as nodes. Empty folders are not included.
  # The resolved structure is attached at this node, so the contents of the
  # `concepts` folder below will become contents of this node (and folder when serialized)
  nodesSelector:
    # A node selector path defines the top-level scope that will be used to
    # generate a hierarchy. For GitHub paths that is a folder in a GitHub repo
    # and the generated nodes' hierarchy corresponds ot the file/folder structure
    # available in the repository at that path.
