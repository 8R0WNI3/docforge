# Node selectors provide options for pulling whole remote hierarchies
# into node (sub)structures, and filtering them to a subset.
nodesSelector:
  # A node selector path defines the top-level scope that will be used to

  # and the generated nodes' hierarchy corresponds ot the file/folder structure
  # available in the repository at that path.
