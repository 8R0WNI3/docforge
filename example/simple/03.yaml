# The documentation structure.
structure:
# Top-level container node with descendent hierarchy defined both with rules
# by its nodeSelector and explicitly with its nodes list property
# name stands for the name of the node. It is mandatory property for container nodes
- name: concepts
  # nodeSelector is resolved to a node hierarchy using path and rules to select nodes
  # to be part of the hierarchy. not specifying anything but path will end up in
  # selecting the whole file/folder structure at path.
  nodesSelector:
    # A node selector path defines the scope that will be used to
    # generate a hierarchy. For GitHub paths that is a folder in a GitHub repo
    # and the generated nodes' hierarchy corresponds ot the file/folder structure
    # available in the repository at that path.
    path: https://github.com/gardener/gardener/tree/v1.43.1/docs/concepts
  # A list of child nodes to this structure node to explicitly define document structure hierarchy.
  # Merging nodeSelector hierarchy with nodes:
  # If both a nodeSelector and nodes are specified on this node, when the node selector is resolved,
  # its resulting top-level nodes will merge with other existing nodes in `nodes`. Nodes with the same
  # name will have their other properties merged, making it possible to add properties to
  # the generated structure or additional nodes.
  nodes:
  # Name of this document node.
  # Name is not mandatory for document nodes if source is provided. With source and no name,
  # the name will be resolved to the resource name in source.
  - name: architecture
    # Source specifies location of document source.
    # The supported sources as of now are GitHub repository documents and wiki pages.
