# Structuring Material

# Container and Document Nodes
#
# A documentation structure definition
# A structure consists of a list of node definitions.
# These could be A) document nodes that reference markdown content sources(s),
# or B) container nodes that structure nodes hierarchically and can contain
# other nodes.
# The structure below will be serialized as follows at destination <d>:
# <d>
#  |__ overview.md (file)
#  |__ concepts (folder)
#  |____ apiserver.md (file)
#
structure:
  # Example of a document node that will be serialized as top-level file in the
  # destination configured in docforge, with name overview.md
  # A node name will be used to identify the serialized node content. When 
  # writing to filesystem, the name translates ot a file name.
  #
  # A document node that has 'source' property provides several additional 
  # options for node names:
  # 1. Node name can be inferred from its source path.
  # 2. Node name can be constructed from an expression using the variables 
  # $name and $ext, which stand for the name of the resource at node's source 
  # path, and $ext stands for its extension.
  - name: overview.md
    # A document node should always have content form source(s) assigned to it.
    # There are multiple options to assign content form source to a node.
    # The simplest one is to use source as in this example, which assigns the 
    # content of the resources at the URL provided by source to this node.
    # Other options with more sophisticated options to control and reorganize
    # content from potentially multiple source are contentSelector and template.

    # Example of a container node with no content source with name concepts.
    # Writing this structure to a file system will serialize it as folder `concepts`.
  - name: concepts
    # The property `nodes` references the direct descendant nodes of this node. It
    # is used to organize nodes into a tree.
    # The property nodes is specific for container nodes. Document nodes do not
    # specify nodes, because they are leafs in the tree nodes structure.
    nodes:
    # Example of a minimal document node specification. The node name is 
    # inferred to be 'apiserver.md' from the path in its source property.
